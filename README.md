#### Who am I? ðŸ˜„

I'm philosopher with a deep interest in technologies and the way they change our lives.

I'm currently working for IBM, leading educative initiatives involving IT training for young students. And I'm also working for CoderHouse, a great bootcamp site in Argentina, where i help students learning React, Node and Data Science. 

### What do I do? ðŸ”­
Currently I'm working in my biggest project with my friend @Gaston: a complex web app social network that lets share and visualize data regarding demographics and other valuables indicators. 
- Front: made in React, material UI, redux and others technologies. 
- Back: Nodes, express and other libraries.
- Data Layer: R! We could chage to Python if it needed.
